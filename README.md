# Insect Galore

This is a demo app to play around with React and some helper libraries, like [Material UI](https://mui.com/) and the [GreenSock Animation Platform](https://greensock.com/gsap/)

The sample data used comes from my own observations uploaded to [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=fedecrc&verifiable=any), downloaded via the provided API and using the native `fetch` api.
